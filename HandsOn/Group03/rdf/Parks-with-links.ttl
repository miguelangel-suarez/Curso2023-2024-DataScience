Colindante con la Cuña Verde de O´Donnell, el parque forestal Fuente Carrantona fue creado con el trasplante de numerosos ejemplares arbóreos de otros lugares de la ciudad y cuenta con una superficie de 22,57 hectáreas. El Parque se estableció en una antigua zona degradada y su recuperación con la replantación de los árboles ha supuesto una importante mejora medioambiental para la zona y el Distrito de Moratalaz. Dentro del carácter funcional de su diseño se han incluido otras zonas de esparcimiento, tanto para la Tercera Edad como para los niños. Para los primeros, se han creado zonas dedicadas a actividades de recreo y descanso con una pista de petanca en el área más accesible desde las viviendas. La zona infantil diseñada con carácter inclusivo, donde pueden disfrutar y jugar todos los niños independientemente de sus limitaciones motoras o sensitivas, siempre rodeados de la vegetación del Parque." ;

    schema-org:description "El proyecto de este parque se inició en el año 2001 su objeto fue recuperar y ajardinar estos terrenos de propiedad pública. Mediante ello se buscó conservar y  potenciar todos los elementos naturales existentes. Dentro de estos elementos cabe destacar el arroyo que divide longitudinalmente el parque y le da nombre. El proyecto se ha ejecutado en varías fases incluyendo todas ellas un carril bici que facilita la movilidad a lo largo de todo el parque:  FASE 1 _ PARQUE ARROYO POZUELO: esta fase se extiende desde la calle Cuesta de Galván que limita con la carretera de Castilla (M-500), hasta la Ctra. Húmera-Aravaca. Fue el inició de este proyecto en el año 2001. Es la zona más ajardinada con extensas praderas de césped y paseos acompañados de arbolado en su mayoría joven. Acoge varias zonas infantiles, pistas de petanca y pistas deportivas bajo una de las cuales existe un amplio estanque de tormentas para la recogida de aguas.  FASE 2_ AMPLIACIÓN PARQUE ARROYO POZUELO: segunda fase de ajardinamiento de la ribera del arroyo, que se empezó en los años 2007-2008, se divide en dos tramos principales:    TRAMO 1. Se sitúa entre la Ctra. Húmera-Aravaca y la calle Golondrina. En esta zona se encuentra el Campo de Fútbol Nuestra Señora del Buen Camino. El ajardinamiento se caracteriza por la presencia de masas de arbustos acompañados de árboles de gran porte, arbolado original de la zona verde y un entramado de caminos que conectan distintas zonas estanciales y áreas infantiles.     TRAMO 2. Entre la calle Golondrina y el límite con el pueblo de Pozuelo. Esta fase se desarrolló solo en la ribera norte del arroyo. En este caso, salvo una zona ajardinada alrededor de una fuente ornamental, el diseño es mucho más forestal con plantaciones de arbolado de diversas especies. También hay zonas infantiles y para mayores, zonas estanciales y pistas deportivas.   FASE 3_ PARQUE. ARROYO POZUELO (AMPLIACIÓN) 2: tercera fase actualmente en desarrollo (iniciada en 2015), entre la calle Golondrina y el límite con el pueblo de Pozuelo, en la ribera sur del arroyo. Diseño forestal con entramado de caminos y renovación del arbolado. En esta zona se encuentra la urbanización privada Colonia Santa Maria." ;

Se encuentra delimitado al sur por la Calle Verde Viento y el Pº de Plata y Castañar, al oeste por la A-42, al norte por el acceso a la Protectora de Animales y al este por la Ctra. de Villaverde a Carabanchel.  El parque cuenta en todo su perímetro con un carril bici que continúa hacia el cercano parque de Plata y Castañar y que está conectado con las vías ciclistas del Plan de Movilidad Ciclista de Madrid.  Lo vertebran dos ejes principales:  Uno situado en la zona sur y que discurre a lo largo de zonas ajardinadas mediante césped, formaciones arbustivas y alineaciones de arbolado, con un sistema de riego de reciente implantación mediante agua regenerada. El otro eje discurre de norte a sur y divide el parque en toda su longitud. Donde encontramos, a ambos lados, diferentes zonas con arbolado, principalmente de pino carrasco, delimitadas por una red de caminos de corte geométrico que recorren el parque flanqueados por alineaciones de diferentes especies como son el almez, el ciruelo rojo o el cinamomo. En la zona noroeste encontramos diferentes estratos vegetales formados por especies como el olivo, el almendro o el ciprés y arbustos como el romero, la salvia o el agracejo que actúan como pantalla acústica del tráfico rodado que circula por la cercana A-42." ;

Está constituida por un espacio cuadrangular limitado por cuatro galerías realizadas a base de columnas dóricas de granito que soportan las típicas zapatas de madera de nuestra arquitectura popular. Sobre ellas se encuentran antiguas casas de una altura, que logran una uniformidad poco habitual. En su centro se dispuso un jardín regular en forma radial compuesto por setos de aligustre, acacias y algunos cedros que rodean una fuente con una escultura de bronce. Completa este ajardinamiento una hilera de acacias alrededor, en las aceras, así como zonas de césped con prunos y flores.

El templo se sitúa con orientación E-O, acompañado por dos sencillas láminas de agua sin caños ni surtidores, que forman una figura troncocónica de reminiscencias egipcias con dos anchos paseos laterales que desembocan en un balcón. Desde aquí se puede contemplar la famosa cornisa del Manzanares, con el Palacio Real, la Casa de Campo y los atardeceres más hermosos de Madrid. Los parterres del jardín, que se desarrollan a ambos lados, sólo realizan la función de marco vegetal de esta atractiva perspectiva, y se cierran en sí mismos con plazas, plátanos de alineación y grupos de palmitos y plantas mediterráneas sobre las praderas.

Su principal característica es que mantiene su condición de bosque, con espacios ajardinados en las zonas colindantes a los espacios urbanos, donde podemos destacar las plantaciones de cedros.    En tiempos de Isabel II se comenzó la repoblación con pinos, principalmente piñoneros y carrascos, actualmente los más comunes del parque. También hay almendros, sobre todo amargos, y acacias, habituales sobre todo cerca de la calle Francos Rodríguez. En las vaguadas húmedas aparecen chopos, fresnos y olmos. En las zonas ajardinadas se encuentran cedros y ciruelos de Pissardii. El sustrato arbustivo está principalmente compuesto por jaras, retamas, romero y zarzamoras, entre otras. La Dehesa de la Villa tiene una importante variedad de avifauna; se han avistado en ella más de 70 especies de aves, lo que la convierte en una joya dentro de todos los parques de Madrid. Los vecinos y usuarios la perciben como un auténtico bosque dentro de la ciudad." ;

Lo cruzan en su interior, el Paseo de Ruperto Chapí, el Paseo de Camoens y C/ Francisco y Jacinto Alcántara. Especial relevancia muestra la zona norte y más antigua del parque, donde se acentúa su carácter paisajista, discurriendo en su interior una ría artificial de unos 600 m de longitud. Existe una gran variedad de especies vegetales, destacando la singular población de coníferas, en contraste con el desarrollo estacional de las frondosas.    De especial mención es la presencia en esta zona de un cedro, 'el Abuelo' (Cedrus atlántica), catalogado como árbol singular, dos ejemplares de Sophora 'péndula', un majestuoso Ginko, las choperas de Populus nigra y las plantaciones en el borde la ría de Corylus, Cornus, etc.. Al final del paseo de Plátanos, que discurre a lo largo de esta zona, se pueden contemplar diversas especies de aves en el Centro de Avifauna, tales como Tarro canelo, Herrerillo común, Carbonero común, Gorrión molinero, Mirlo común, etc., disponiendo así mismo de paneles informativos.  Las ampliaciones del Parque de Príncipe Pío y de Ferraz, difieren de la tipología paisajista del diseño original del parque, desarrollando trazados más actuales." ;

    schema-org:description "El parque de Pradolongo es el principal pulmón verde del Distrito de Usera y una de las zonas verdes más emblemáticas de Madrid, tanto por su morfología y variedad de usos, como por su extensión, casi 60 ha. El parque está articulado en tres grandes ejes que confluyen en la zona central donde se sitúa un templete y un gran lago de tres hectáreas.  Es un espacio de gran valor ambiental. Un jardín botánico de una hectárea se ubica al norte del lago. Esta superficie está formada por parterres con diseño geométrico. En él están representadas 43 familias botánicas con paneles interpretativos que describen sus principales características. Asimismo, el jardín dispone de mesas y bancos para la realización de actividades de educación medioambiental.   Además del jardín botánico, destaca una senda ecológica de más de tres kilómetros. Está dotada de paneles interpretativos que permiten conocer las especies vegetales además de la fauna y del ecosistema del parque.   El parque de Pradolongo es una zona verde para el encuentro y el ocio. Ofrece múltiples posibilidades a ciudadanos de todas las edades: senderismo; footing; patinaje; ciclismo (en circuito y en carril bici); observación de ave; piragüismo; uso de teledirigidos en el lago; pista de calva para juegos tradicionales. Además, el parque está dotado de otras áreas deportivas, infantiles y de mayores. Uno de los espacios más visitados por los menores es el castillo de juegos.  En esta gran zona verde destacan especies arbóreas como el olmo de Siberia, el arce negundo y alineaciones de tilos, pinos, chopos y olmos de bola. Con respecto a los arbustos, los más frecuentes son los rosales, piracantas, adelfas, cornejos y abelias. El riego de las plantaciones del parque se realiza con agua regenerada.  Diversa fauna habita en este parque. Aves acuáticas como los ánades reales y las gaviotas reidoras frecuentan las láminas de agua. También viven las propias de las zonas verdes urbanas como son los mirlos, carboneros, herrerillos, pinzones, petirrojos, urracas y palomas torcaces entre otras muchas." ;

Se caracteriza por los bosquetes de lilos y de árboles del amor que proporcionan un hermoso colorido primaveral al jardín. En sus praderas y paseos se observan notables ejemplares de robles, pinos, cipreses, tejos, cedros, plátanos y castaños de indias. Esta riqueza vegetal alberga una fauna muy variada, destacando entre las aves: mirlos, palomas torcaces, pitos reales, herrerillos, petirrojos, ruiseñores, etc., además de cisnes negros y ánades y entre los mamíferos: ardillas rojas, musarañas, ratones comunes y ratones de campo.

    schema-org:description "La Casa de Campo de Madrid fue Real Sitio destinado a la caza y el recreo de la Monarquía desde la adquisición de la primitiva finca de la familia Vargas por Felipe II    en 1562 hasta la incautación de los bienes de la Corona por Decreto del Gobierno de la Segunda  República de 20 de abril de 1931. En virtud de dicho Decreto, los terrenos de la Casa de Campo y del Campo del Moro fueron cedidos al Ayuntamiento de Madrid para ser destinados a parques de recreo e instrucción.   En 2010 se declara Bien de Interés Cultural, en la categoría de Sitio Histórico. La Casa de Campo constituye actualmente el principal pulmón de la ciudad y alberga numerosas actividades ligadas a su finalidad como lugar de recreo e instrucción de los ciudadanos.  A su valor ecológico y paisajístico se suma una importante carga histórica, materializada en significativos restos arqueológicos, un conjunto de edificaciones y obra civil de carácter histórico-monumental, testimonio de su etapa como Real Sitio y una amplia representación de arquitecturas contemporáneas de su etapa como parque público.  Parque histórico de carácter principalmente forestal de gran extensión con un relieve ondulado de suaves pendientes en el que sobresalen pequeños cerros, surcado por pequeños valles por donde discurren algunos arroyos permanentes y otros estacionales que confluyen en el río Manzanares. La mayoría tienen su nacimiento dentro del Parque, si bien los dos más importantes, Antequina y Meaques, nacen fuera del mismo. Entre las láminas de agua cabe destacar la del Lago y varias charcas artificiales para hábitat y alimentación de la fauna.  Varios recintos de gestión independiente se encuentran en su interior: entre otros el Parque de Atracciones, Parque Zoológico, Recinto Ferial, Venta del Batán y el Club de Campo.  En su vegetación destacan encinares, vegetación potencial del Parque, retamares, fresnedas, olmedas, bosquetes de ribera y las repoblaciones de pinos y arizónicas. En algunas zonas la encina empieza a emerger iniciando un proceso natural de sustitución del pinar. Este parque se incluye entre las visitas recomendadas a turistas que visitan la ciudad, según la web oficial de turismo de Madrid." ;

El taller de arquitectura de Bofill es el encargado del Plan Director para transformar esta zona, dotada inicialmente con las necesarias infraestructuras de saneamiento, abastecimiento y electricidad, en una zona de paseo y de expansión para el ciudadano. En el riego del parque se utiliza agua regenerada procedente de la estación regeneradora de aguas residuales de La China.    Tres elementos vertebran el parque en su conjunto: el trazado del río propiamentedicho, un eje peatonal que atraviesa el parque en línea recta como alternativa al río y una trama ortogonal de caminos. Recorriendo el parque de norte a sur podemos encontrar una Plaza Verde, con forma de media luna; el Paseo de los Sentidos, bordeado de grandes árboles con una pasarela peatonal de grandes dimensiones, plazas cuadradas con laberintos, un umbráculo frondoso y dos fuentes con juegos de agua; una Pérgola; La Atalaya, montaña de escombros transformada que se corona con una escultura de Manuel Valdés 'La Dama del Manzanares'; el Área de los Deportes con dos campos de fútbol, pistas polivalentes, una zona de juegos infantiles, vestuarios y aseos; la Pradera, un gran césped de grandes dimensiones y el Parque del Belvedere, con juegos infantiles y de petanca." ;

El parque se inauguró el 4 de mayo de 2007, con una superficie de 10,41 ha. (fases I y II) correspondiente a las zonas estancial y temática. El diseño de la zona estancial (Jardín del Sol y el Agua) se articula desde la plaza del reloj de sol, centro y foco de canales, plantaciones y caminos. Acoge y fusiona plantaciones de especies tradicionalmente mediterráneas (olivo, vid y frutales) con otras de la moderna jardinería. La zona temática (Jardines Mediterráneos) es representativa de la evolución histórica de la jardinería mediterránea. En ella se encuentra el Jardín de Oriente Próximo, el Jardín Medieval, el Jardín Árabe, el Palmeral o el Paraíso. Y, por supuesto, el agua siempre presente, con juegos, ría, canaletas y albercas. La Zona Deportiva (Fase III) del parque, con una superficie de 2,8 Has. en la que destacan el campo de rugby profesional de hierba artificial y 2 pistas de pádel, además de la lámina ornamental y las zonas ajardinadas. Existe un monolito conmemorativo en el que aparece inscrita la frase de Juan Pablo II: ' Con mis brazos abiertos os llevo a todos en el corazón', dedicada al pueblo de Madrid con motivo de su visita en el año 2003." ;

    schema-org:description "Es el parque más representativo de Hortaleza inaugurado por Enrique Tierno Galván en julio de 1983. Las asociaciones de vecinos del barrio de Villa Rosa participaron en el diseño de esta zona verde de 5 hectáreas. El parque Villa Rosa-Paco Caño ofrece numerosos atractivos entre los que destaca una ría que recorre longitudinalmente la superficie y que puede cruzarse por cualquiera de los nueve puentes. La ría nace en el reloj de sol horizontal de piedra artificial con gnomon de acero y finaliza en el palomar. A lo largo del parque se pueden observar diversos elementos singulares como la casa derrumbada. Estas ruinas son  una alegoría de un edificio bombardeado y en su interior se alza un monumento con una placa con la efigie de Enrique Tierno Galván. Muy próximo se sitúa el templete como homenaje a la tranquilidad. En 2016 se inauguró el primer circuito inclusivo en la Comunidad de Madrid con recorridos señalizados y adaptados para personas con diversidad funcional. Es el número 31 del mundo y consta de dos recorridos circulares de 4 y 5,37 kilómetros que comienzan en el parque paralelo a la calle Aconcagua, pasan por esta zona verde y continúan junto al  anillo verde ciclista. Los recorridos están señalizados y adaptados para personas en sillas de ruedas, sordas, ciegas o con problemas intelectuales o de movilidad.  Desde octubre de 2016 el parque se llama Villa Rosa-Paco Caño, en homenaje al histórico dirigente vecinal Paco Caño, presidente de la Federación Regional de Asociaciones de Vecinos de Madrid (FRAVM y fundador de la asociación de vecinos Villa Rosa. En su memoria se instaló un monolito bajo el templete con la inscripción 'Hay personas que luchan un día y son buenas; hay otras que luchan un año y son mejores; hay quienes luchan muchos años y son muy buenas. Pero las hay que luchan toda la vida; esas son imprescindibles'." ;

    schema-org:description "El Invernadero de Arganzuela está situado en el Paseo de la Chopera, junto al río Manzanares. Es un edificio que forma parte del conjunto arquitectónico del histórico Matadero Municipal y del Mercado de Ganados. Fue proyectado y construido por el arquitecto Don Luis Bellido y González entre los años 1908 y 1928. Este recinto es conocido popularmente como 'Nave de las Patatas' y fue restaurado y rehabilitado para su uso como Invernadero en el año 1992. La remodelación del edificio le ha situado en una posición de relevancia dentro de la arquitectura industrial. Se tomó como modelo los valiosos invernaderos decimonónicos contenidos en los parques de Viena o Londres, así como toda la Arquitectura del Hierro representativa del s. XIX. El Invernadero Palacio de Cristal, está distribuido en un escenario central y cuatro espacios cerrados que representan microclimas diferentes, albergando cuatro clases diferentes de plantas: dos tropicales, uno subtropical y uno desértico. También dispone de láminas de agua, fuentes, rías y acuarios poblados de peces de diferente hábitat." ;

Está clasificado como suelo no urbanizable de protección forestal.El monte presenta un relieve bastante accidentado sin cotas de altitud demasiado elevadas (el punto más alto está a 757 metros), aunque existen algunas zonas llanas en el Aula de la Naturaleza y el Palacio Valdés.       Historia del Área Forestal de Tres Cantos  'Finca rústica destinada a caza con pastos, monte bajo y plantío de viñedo, con unas cinco mil cepas...' Así comienza la inscripción de la finca en el Registro de la Propiedad de Colmenar Viejo. Según dicho registro la superficie inicial de la finca era de 277 ha.Esta propiedad fue vendida por don Felipe González Rojas mediante escritura otorgada en Madrid el 31 de octubre de 1917 a don Horacio Echevarrieta y Mauri, un industrial bilbaíno muy influyente. El palacete que está en el interior de la finca llamado 'Palacio Valdés' data de años posteriores.El 31 de octubre de 1941 el Ayuntamiento de Madrid, siendo alcalde don Alberto Alcocer, adquirió la finca por acuerdo municipal." ;

Por un lado, están los Jardines de Azorín que deben su nombre al escritor José Martínez Ruiz “Azorín” y por otro, el Jardín de la Glorieta de Boccherini que alberga un busto dedicado al músico italiano Luigi Boccherini. Ambos jardines están compuestos en su mayor parte por praderas y macizos de rosales, si bien en el Jardín de Boccherini también hay grupos de palmáceas. Estos recintos ajardinados se sitúan sobre lo que en el pasado fue la primera puerta de Madrid “la puerta de la Vega” que abría la ciudad hasta la vega. Se cree que es la puerta por la que entró el conquistador Alfonso VI. En 1708 se construyó una muralla en la que se colocó un medallón de la Virgen de la Almudena y cuya situación coincide con el lugar que ocupa la Catedral de la Almudena." ;

Hasta 2007 no tuvo ningún uso y fue en ese año cuando el Ayuntamiento de Madrid convirtió el espacio en un jardín temático de dalias, la antigua Dalieda de San Francisco. Posteriormente, en 2016,  se modificó  la composición de las plantaciones y se apostó por los rosales debido a su gran capacidad de adaptación al clima madrileño y a su mayor floración. En la actualidad los Jardines de San Francisco el Grande cuenta con 21 variedades de rosales que alcanzan su máxima esplendor en los meses de mayo y junio. El parque encuentra en una zona denominada “Las Vistillas” por ser la más alta del Madrid de los Austrias y su mirador se ha convertido en uno de los lugares más transitados para ver puestas de sol en la ciudad. Antecede al mirador el grupo escultórico San Isidro Labrador, obra en la que se representa al patrón de Madrid recostado y a un ángel que posa una mano sobre su cabeza para inducirle a dormir. Esta fue una de las esculturas que realizó Santiago Costa en 1952 para homenajear al arquitecto Juan de Villanueva. Su emplazamiento original fue la fuente de la glorieta de San Vicente, donde estuvo hasta 1995." ;

    schema-org:description "Los Jardines del Descubrimiento se encuentran en el centro neurálgico de la capital, delimitados por las calles Goya, Serrano, de la Armada Española y el eje Castellana-Recoletos. La Antigua Casa de la Moneda y el Timbre ocupaba estos terrenos hasta los años 70, fecha en la que se remodeló la plaza y se crearon los jardines y el antiguo Centro Cultural de la Villa. En la actualidad es un lugar de referencia para los madrileños ya que su excelente ubicación los convierte en uno de los principales escenarios para la celebración de todo tipo de eventos: actos de conmemoración del Día de la Hispanidad, ferias, manifestaciones y encuentros deportivos.  El diseño original  de la jardinería  presentaba grandes áreas geométricas de césped en la zona  central de la plaza, acompañadas de macizos de flor y ejemplares arbóreos de gran porte como pinos, cipreses y magnolios en las franjas laterales. Debido a las filtraciones producidas en las instalaciones subterráneas y al gasto de agua para su mantenimiento, en 2006 las praderas se sustituyeron por grava ornamental. En la actualidad bajo su superficie se encuentran el aparcamiento público Plaza de Colón y el Fernán Gómez Centro Cultural de la Villa.  Los Jardines del Descubrimiento deben su nombre a Cristóbal Colón. Un gran monumento neogótico con la estatua de Cristóbal Colón ha presidido los jardines desde 1972 a 2009, año en el que con motivo de las obras de remodelación del eje Prado-Recoletos fue de nuevo trasladado a la que fuera su ubicación inicial, el centro de la rotonda de la plaza de Colón. En el lateral de la calle Serrano se sitúa el Monumento al Descubrimiento de América compuesto por cuatro grandes bloques de hormigón con grabados y textos de la historia del Descubrimiento. En estos céntricos jardines ondea desde 2002 la bandera más grande de España, con 294 metros cuadrados -21 x 14- de longitud y 35 kilos de peso. Está sostenida por un mástil de 50 metros de altura que gira en la dirección del viento lo que impide que se enrolle. Mirando a esta bandera se colocó en 2014 una estatua en honor al almirante Blas de Lezo.  Otras denominaciones: Jardines de la Plaza Colón" ;

Se distinguen tres espacios diferenciados: el parterre central, que se desarrolla en el entorno del famoso grupo escultórico ecuestre de Felipe IV, y los jardines del cabo Noval y de Lepanto, que se sitúan a ambos lados.    El parterre central sigue el modelo decimonónico de jardinería: seto de complicados diseños geométricos y figuras topiarias (ejemplares perfilados con diversas formas), todo ello guardando simetría con un eje principal. Se utilizan: para el seto el boj, en las esquinas tejos y entre ellos cipreses. Se encuentra un ejemplar de magnolio en el centro de cada figura, y dos fuentes artísticas en los cuadros más cercanos a palacio. Los jardines de Lepanto y Cabo Noval son espacios abiertos y ajardinados para el descanso y recreo de los visitantes. La cantidad de árboles hace de ambos jardines un lugar idóneo para la estancia y el ocio. Los jardines del Cabo Noval, integrados principalmente por plantaciones de plátanos, ocupan la parte septentrional de la Plaza de Oriente, junto a la calle de San Quintín. Los jardines de Lepanto se encuentran en la parte meridional de la plaza y su composición es muy similar." ;

Dentro del jardín destacan varios arbustos singulares y una gran pérgola de rosales trepadores. El Jardín original data aproximadamente del año 1750. Su aspecto actual se debe al encargo que en 1920 realizaron los Marqueses de la Romana al pintor y diseñador de jardines Javier de Winthuysen. La última restauración la realizó la paisajista toscana Lucía Serredi en el año 2002." ;

Recuperando el estilo andalusí, este parque se creó para recordar la diversidad de culturas que han vivido en la ciudad de Madrid. Existen diferentes especies arbóreas, un almez y una higuera son los ejemplares más antiguos. Las zonas verdes recorren la muralla islámica y los cipreses de los parterres continúan el diseño de la fuente con forma de estrella de seis puntas que preside el parque. Entre los años 860 y 880 el emir Mühammad I fundó la ciudad de Madrid (Mayrit) como enclave militar. Los restos de la muralla islámica que pueden verse  en este parque pertenecen al primer recinto amurallado de Madrid, construido en el siglo IX durante el dominio andalusí de la región. Se conserva un tramo de la muralla de más de 120 metros de longitud, con una altura máxima de 11,50 metros y un espesor de 2,60 metros en el que destacan varios torreones de planta cuadrangular." ;

    schema-org:description "sta Rosaleda fue creada en el año 1955. Su inspirador fue el Director de Parques y Jardines de Madrid en aquella época, Don Ramón Ortiz Ferré, de quien lleva el nombre. En 2006 la Rosaleda fue galardonada por la Word Federation of Rose Societies con el “Award of Garden Excellence”, reconociéndola como una de las Rosaledas excepcionales entre las de todo el mundo. Está situada en un espacio de unos 32.000 m2  dentro del Parque del Oeste de Madrid. Esta zona plana, a modo de una terraza, fue acondicionada con los medios de la época (es decir, sin la asistencia de ningún tipo de maquinaria de movimiento de tierras) en una ladera con fuerte pendiente de dicho parque, orientada al SO. En total en esta Rosaleda se encuentran plantados unos 20.000 rosales, que corresponden a más de 650 variedades diferentes de rosales modernos (400 de porte bajo y el resto de trepadores, llorones, pie alto, etc...). La disposición del jardín de rosas es totalmente regular y simétrica. Todos los años se celebra en esta Rosaleda el Concurso Popular Rosa de Madrid y el Concurso Internacional de Rosas Nuevas Villa de Madrid con la participación de rosales de todo el mundo. A ambos lados de su entrada principal se disponen las platabandas de las variedades premiadas en anteriores ediciones del Concurso Internacional de Rosas Nuevas de la Villa de Madrid.. Las platabandas en aspa albergan los rosales de concurso de la edición del año en curso. El resto de la superficie se encuentra dividida en parcelas que sirven de asiento a las variedades que constituyen el fondo de exposición de la Rosaleda. En la Rosaleda de Madrid existen representaciones de las más importantes variedades de obtentores de todo el mundo. Asimismo tiene una importante representación de variedades de rosales españoles y además de servir de soporte a tan relevante colección, sirve como parcela de ensayo para ver el comportamiento de dichos rosales en nuestras latitudes.

    schema-org:description "Esta nueva zona verde está situada entre las calles Fresnedillas, Los Gavilanes y Gabriela Mistral en el Distrito Fuencarral-El Pardo. Se ha estructurado mediante caminos terminados en jabre (tipo de tierra), aprovechando las sendas creadas por el uso de los vecinos. Las diferencias de nivel existentes entre la calle Fresnedillas y el fondo de la vaguada y entre ésta y el carril bici se salvan con hileras de gaviones (muros de contención realizados con piedras retenidas con malla de alambre). Estos muros que suavizan las pendientes y evitan las escorrentías crean espacios, casi planos entre ellos, donde se han realizado las plantaciones. En la zona baja de la parcela se localiza un bosquete de fresnos, por donde en su día discurría el arroyo del Fresno. También se han plantado alineaciones arbóreas y arbustivas y parterres con plantas de temporada y aromáticas. El parque tiene instalado riego por goteo y se ha dotado la zona con alumbrado público. Cada área dispone de su mobiliario específico con bancos corridos sobre los gaviones y papeleras. Además se ha construido una red de saneamiento para evacuar las escorrentías que se produzcan al alcantarillado público. La zona al sureste del 'carril bici' está adecuada como zona deportiva, estructurando lo que ya existía: un solar con una superficie bastante regular que se utilizaba para la práctica informal de juegos deportivos. Se ha construido un estacionamiento en superficie por petición vecinal, con 18 plazas, que suple las que utilizaban los vecinos en una zona que ahora está ajardinada." ;

Posee zonas deportivas para mayores, zonas infantiles y un largo carril bici que lo recorre. En 2020 se ha remodelado creando nuevos paseos y caminos, dotado de más espacios ajardinados, más áreas caninas y mejorado los sistemas de riego y drenaje. Dispone de un circuito que atraviesa el parque de sur a norte y del que nacen caminos secundarios que conectan con las diferentes dotaciones: áreas infantiles, caninas, deportivas o estanciales.   Para aislar de los efectos negativos que genera el tráfico de la M-40, se ha realizado una plantación lineal a modo de pantalla vegetal. Esta cortina verde de 700 metros es de doble alineación. La primera fila la ocupan cipreses, un arbolado de hoja perenne y crecimiento rápido y la segunda arbustos de buen porte y desarrollo frondoso como arces rojos, tuyas orientales y azahares de China. Esta pantalla, además de proteger de la contaminación atmosférica y visual, sirve de guía y orientación a los vecinos, ya que permite identificar el perímetro del parque. En mayo de 2018 la Junta de Gobierno de la Ciudad aprobó el cambio de denominación para homenajear a Jesús Pérez Quijano, alcalde de Vicálvaro cuando era municipio independiente de Madrid. Hasta ese momento era el Parque Valdebernardo M-40.  Otras denominaciones: Parque Norte de Valdebernardo" ;

    schema-org:description "La finca de Torre Arias tiene 18,44 hectáreas de superficie y se encuentra en el barrio de Salvador en el distrito de San Blas-Canillejas En este parque se puede observar la evolución de las Quintas madrileñas durante más de cuatro siglos donde convivian el uso lúdico, por parte de la aristocracia, y la explotación agropecuaria, que servía se soporte económico a la Quinta. Todo ello presidido por un imponente palacio con sus caballerizas. En la Quinta se pueden encontrar hasta 58 especies diferentes de árboles y arbustos, algunos tan singulares como una encina de más de 300 años y ejemplares de almendros, pinos y cedros de importantes dimensiones. Su última propietaria, Tatiana Pérez de Guzmán el Bueno, firmó junto a su marido el 15 julio de 1986, un convenio de permuta por el cual la finca pasaba a ser propiedad del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, pero manteniéndose en usufructo hasta el fallecimiento de la condesa, ocurrido el primero de octubre de 2012. A su fallecimiento, la totalidad del ámbito pasó a ser, por tanto, de propiedad municipal y a finales de noviembre de 2016 abrió sus puertas a todo el pueblo de Madrid y visitantes. La Quinta de Torre Arias ha sido declarada Bien de Interés Cultural de la Comunidad de Madrid, en la categoría de conjunto histórico, la Quinta y palacio de Torre Arias en Madrid por Decreto 59/2022, de 13 de julio de la Consejería de Cultura, Turismo y Deporte La Quinta de Torre Arias se encuentra en proceso de restauración por lo que mejorarán sus condiciones y elementos con la introducción de nuevas instalaciones, mejora del viario, adecuación de las zonas ajardinadas existentes e incluyendo nuevas plantaciones, así como restauración de los elementos del jardín. Hasta que dicha restauración no esté finalizada existen diferentes zonas de la Quinta que permanecen cerradas al público, al igual que el palacio, que no es visitable. El personal municipal responsable de la conservación de la Quinta, ofrece otras actividades educativo-ambientales para grupos escolares, así como para grupos organizados de adultos. Estas actividades se reservarán directamente en la dirección del parque a través del correo electrónico parqueshistoricos@madrid.es. Se puede consultar el programa de estas actividades en este enlace. Por otro lado, el Ayuntamiento de Madrid, desde el Departamento de Educación Ambiental, organiza visitas guiadas periódicas, dentro del programa Hábitat Madrid.

    schema-org:description "El parque de la Gavia constituye una de las zonas verdes más singulares del Ensanche de Vallecas, con una superficie cercana a las 36 hectáreas. Su diseño inicial es obra del reconocido arquitecto japonés, premio Priztker 2013, Toyo Ito, el cual fue completado y modificado por otro procedente de un proceso participativo de la ciudadanía. De marcado carácter oriental, su paisaje está formado por suaves colinas donde destacan bosquetes de árboles de varias especies, entre los que predominan álamos blancos, membrilleros, encinas o chopos negros, y una ría central jalonada por macizos de arbustos como rosales silvestres, mimbreras y otras especies de ribera. El Ayuntamiento ha llevado a cabo la rehabilitación de esta zona verde en dos fases. La primera, que finalizó en enero de 2018, incluyó el cerramiento de todo el parque para proteger su singularidad, la reposición de plantaciones y elementos deteriorados por el vandalismo, la instalación de red de riego telegestionada, la acometida de agua regenerada y mejoras en pavimentación y drenaje. La segunda fase, finalizada en 2021, comprende la totalidad del parque. El proyecto ha tenido en cuenta las propuestas vecinales recogidas en el proceso participativo llevado a cabo por las asociaciones vecinales. El parque consta, entre otros elementos, de 3.322 árboles, 170.742 unidades arbustivas, 7.460 m2 de césped y 36.000 m2 de pradera natural. Además se ha construido 1 área canina, 4 áreas infantiles y 9 zonas deportivas, dotadas todas ellas de nuevos elementos de juego. Se ha instalado igualmente el mobiliario urbano necesario para el disfrute de los usuarios, formado por papeleras, bancos, fuentes de beber, red de alumbrado público, etc. Las diferentes colinas permiten la visión del paisaje desde diferentes angulaciones y alturas. Los distintos usos asignados a cada colina son:   Plaza del agua: En esta colina el agua es el punto de atención. Desde aquí puedes hacerte una visión global del parque, además es un magnífico punto de reunión para diversas actividades. Es la única zona con pavimento duro del parque (pero con criterios de drenaje urbano sostenible).  Bosque de los sentidos: Sus caminos están enmarcados por amebas ajardinadas que llevan a distintas áreas de juego:  Área de integración: Pensada para estimular los sentidos, fomentar el ejercicio físico, la creatividad y la fantasía, además de facilitar el desarrollo del equilibrio, la motricidad y la coordinación, favoreciendo la inclusividad plena de todos los niños sin importar sus capacidades físicas o intelectuales, para que todos jueguen y se relacionen en un mismo entorno.  Zona de aventura: Aprovechando la zona de más desnivel del árbol se diseñan zonas de toboganes, tirolinas y juego multiaventura con forma de bambú gigante.  Zona de los sentidos: Espacio dedicado a juegos infantiles para agudizar los sentidos: instrumentos musicales, juegos de tacto, sensoriales, de tacto, etc.  Árbol del agua: La forma del árbol de agua permanece en su zona acuática con aspecto de lago con unas formas muy geométricas, que evidencian por su diseño 6 plazas principales bordeando todo el árbol: 3 de ellas son eminentemente paisajísticas, recreando en cada plaza un aspecto similar al de jardín japonés, sobrio y elegante y las otras tres plazas tienen varios espacios para distintos usos: mesas de picnic, zonas de ejercicios para personas mayores, etc.  Ría central: Inicia su recorrido en una pequeña cascada próxima a la avenida Mayorazgo, con discurrir este – oeste y termina en un lago. Divide el espacio en dos zonas unidas por dos puentes peatonales y alrededor lleva un paseo con plantaciones de ribera de arbolado y arbustivas.  Colina sobre ruedas: Espacio destinado a distintas prácticas deportivas asociadas a ruedas: bicicletas, skate, etc.  Colina del reciclaje: Los neumáticos que rodeaban el entorno han tomado forma de mobiliario en la búsqueda de aprender a valorar y cuidar lo que nos rodea y pertenece a todos; limpiar el paisaje; promover un modelo de gestión honesta y transparente de residuos y profundizar en el concepto de reutilización como forma creativa de relacionarnos con nuestros desechos. Esta colina pretende dar un valor único por las connotaciones educativas y los valores ambientales asociados a él, que son inexistentes en otros espacios lúdicos de la ciudad.  Zona de escalada: Adosada a la colina del reciclaje se ha proyectado un rocódromo con pared vertical con distintas alturas para la práctica de la escalada para distintas edades.  Zona de parkour: Situada junto a la zona de escalada.  Colina del viento: Espacio libre dedicado a los amantes del vuelo con cometas.  Mirador estelar: Su función es múltiple, pretende ser un punto de encuentro y por otro en el extremo más al sur, pueda observarse el cielo vallecano.  Área deportiva: En una zona verde el espacio donde disfrutar del deporte no debe faltar. Se ha orientado a varias prácticas y varias edades aprovechando el espacio sobre la cubierta del estanque de tormentas: zona de entrenamiento y pistas multideportes.  Zona canina: Situada sobre el estanque de tormentas, alberga una zona amplia para entrenamiento canino.  El parque quedará unido en el futuro a la zona verde de La Atalayuela, mediante el cerramiento de éste que se ha ejecutado en esta actuación, habiendo sido declarados los dos espacios singulares. Sumando una superficie total aproximada de 48,6 hectáreas." ;

    schema-org:description "El Parque forestal de Valdebebas-Felipe VI se establece sobre eriales, antiguas zonas de cultivo y grandes vertederos y escombreras. Con una extensión aproximada de 470 ha   y con una silueta que representa un gran árbol, el parque está situado al noreste de la ciudad, en el distrito de Hortaleza.  El parque se compone de una serie de zonas, en gran parte de carácter forestal, pero también con superficies de jardinería urbana. La zona central constituye el núcleo del parque. Recrea un gran parque forestal dentro de la trama urbana, con principios de sostenibilidad, representando los principales paisajes del centro de la península a través de las formaciones vegetales que las caracterizan. Son las denominadas zonas de Copa y Campo Abierto, que representan la mayor superficie del parque forestal. Dentro de este gran espacio se sitúan zonas de carácter jardinero que tienen una finalidad vertebradora, al servir de orientación dentro del mismo y que aportan personalidad al ámbito gracias a su singularidad. Se trata del Laberinto (con una estructura central de madera en forma de espiral ascendente y un mirador), del Arboreto (donde de cinco cubetas afloran islas con formaciones vegetales) y de las Terrazas (superficie compuesta por una serie de plataformas ajardinadas con desarrollo en cascada descendente hacia el río)." ;
